### Catherine's personal page using bootstrap
This website contains three linked pages, created using bootstrap. It is a reapeat of the previous github submission which was created using only html and css. Bootstrap was used to create the navbar and to organised both the portfolio and contact pages using rows and columns. This enables the website to be responsive when viewed on different sizes of screen.
